## Overview
This project is about creating an in-memory key-value database that supports transactions. Transactions ensure that updates are either fully completed or not at all, preventing any incomplete writes. The key features include functions to start a transaction, insert data, retrieve data, commit changes, and roll back if needed, all to keep the database consistent.

## Instructions
1. Get Python installed on your computer.
2. Clone the repo or download the `db.py` file to your machine.
3. If you want to check out the example usage in the instructions, uncomment the `main` section in `db.py`.
4. Run the file with `python db.py`.

## Future Improvements
To make this assignment clearer and easier to grade in the future, you could add an example test file or ask students to create a test script to check the database's functionality. The assignment could explain how to create and run a test file. Including a basic test script or requiring the main function to show all methods in action will help make grading more consistent. For example, the commented-out main functionality in `db.py` could be a great starting point for testing.
